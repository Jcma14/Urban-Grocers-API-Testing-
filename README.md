# Urban Grocers API Testing  

The **Urban Grocers** project is a simulated online grocery service where I validated new backend functionality by testing specific API endpoints against documented requirements.  

## Project Goal  
The goal of this project was to validate new functionalities in the Urban Grocers API, focusing on **product kit management** and **delivery services**.  

I tested two key endpoints:  
- **POST /api/v1/kits/{id}/products** â†’ allows adding groceries to a kit with a limit of up to 30 products.  
- **POST /order-and-go/v1/delivery** â†’ checks the availability and cost of the delivery service.  

## Approach  
I used **Postman** to design and run test cases, covering **positive**, **negative**, and **boundary** scenarios.  
The outcome was a successful validation of the back-end requirements and a stronger understanding of **API testing, JSON response analysis,** and **business-oriented test design**.  

This project enhanced my ability to align technical testing with **real product needs**.

## Key Results
- Designed and executed **23 test cases** covering positive, negative, and boundary scenarios.  
- Tested **2 critical API endpoints** using both **GET** and **POST** requests.  
- Reported and documented **9 bugs**, contributing to improved API reliability and alignment with requirements.
